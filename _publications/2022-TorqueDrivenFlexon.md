excerpt: '**Abstract:** The intervertebral disc is a complex structure that experiences multiaxial stresses regularly. Disc failure through herniation is a common cause of lower back pain, which causes reduced mobility and debilitating pain, resulting in heavy socioeconomic burdens. Unfortunately, herniation etiology is not well understood, partially due to challenges in replicating herniation in vitro. Previous studies suggest that flexion elevated risks of herniation. Thus, the objective of this study was to use a multiscale and multiphasic finite element model to evaluate the risk of failure under torque- or muscle-driven flexion. Models were developed to represent torque-driven flexion with the instantaneous center of rotation (ICR) located on the disc, and the more physiologically representative muscle-driven flexion with the ICR located anterior of the disc. Model predictions highlighted disparate disc mechanics regarding bulk deformation, stress-bearing mechanisms, and intradiscal stress-strain distributions. Specifically, failure was predicted to initiate at the bone-disc boundary under torque-driven flexion, which may explain why endplate junction failure, instead of herniation, has been the more common failure mode observed in vitro. By contrast, failure was predicted to initiate in the posterolateral annulus fibrosus under muscle-driven flexion, resulting in consistent herniation. Our findings also suggested that muscle-driven flexion combined with axial compression could be sufficient for provoking herniation in vitro and in silico. In conclusion, this study provided a computational framework for designing in vitro testing protocols that can advance the assessment of disc failure behavior and the performance of engineered disc implants.'
