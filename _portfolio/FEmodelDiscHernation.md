The intervertebral disc is a complex structure that experiences multiaxial stresses regu-
larly. Disc failure through herniation is a common cause of lower back pain, which
causes reduced mobility and debilitating pain, resulting in heavy socioeconomic burdens.
Unfortunately, herniation etiology is not well understood, partially due to challenges in
replicating herniation in vitro. Previous studies suggest that flexion elevated risks of her-
niation. Thus, the objective of this study was to use a multiscale and multiphasic finite
element model to evaluate the risk of failure under torque- or muscle-driven flexion. Mod-
els were developed to represent torque-driven flexion with the instantaneous center of
rotation (ICR) located on the disc, and the more physiologically representative muscle-
driven flexion with the ICR located anterior of the disc. Model predictions highlighted
disparate disc mechanics regarding bulk deformation, stress-bearing mechanisms, and
intradiscal stressâ€“strain distributions. Specifically, failure was predicted to initiate at the
bone-disc boundary under torque-driven flexion, which may explain why endplate junc-
tion failure, instead of herniation, has been the more common failure mode observed
in vitro. By contrast, failure was predicted to initiate in the posterolateral annulus fibro-
sus under muscle-driven flexion, resulting in consistent herniation. Our findings also sug-
gested that muscle-driven flexion combined with axial compression could be sufficient for
provoking herniation in vitro and in silico. In conclusion, this study provided a computa-
tional framework for designing in vitro testing protocols that can advance the assessment
of disc failure behavior and the performance of engineered disc implants.
