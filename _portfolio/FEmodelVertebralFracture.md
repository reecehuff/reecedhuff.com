Vertebral fractures are burdensome on oneâ€™s quality of life, and they affect nearly one-fourth of men and women over the age of 50. Yet, these fractures are not well understood and are improperly di- agnosed using current methods; nearly three-fourths of individuals with a vertebral fracture are not clinically deemed to be at high-risk of fracture. A fundamental barrier in accurately modeling ver- tebral fracture is a limited understanding of how forces propagating from the disc into the vertebra are affected by degeneration of the disc and aging of the bone. Therefore, the goal of this project was to establish how the likelihood of vertebral fracture changes with the age of the bone and disc degeneration. Aging and disc degeneration were simulated using a state-of-the-art finite-element model of a lumbar spine segment. A multi-axial yield criterion was applied to each simulation to see where bone was at high-risk of fracture. Results indicate that the loss of bone affects fracture risk more than disc degeneration does. Failure consistently occurred in regions in and below the superior endplate, which is consistent with previous findings. Interestingly, vertebrae with healthy discs were at greater risk of fracturing compared to those with degenerated discs, suggesting de- generation may serve to protect the vertebra from fracture. Overall, the results not only establish how disc degeneration and aging of the bone each contribute to the likelihood of vertebral fracture but also may lead to an improvement in the diagnostic tools used to assess patient risk.
