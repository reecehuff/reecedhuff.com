The goal of my project was to improve the performance of an image-processing method used to study the mechanisms of bone failure in the spine. Failure of this bone, the vertebra, is known clinically as a “vertebral fracture”. Vertebral fractures comprise approximately 700,000 out of a total 1.5 million osteoporic fractures annually [[1]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/8756328295002584?via%3Dihub). Total costs due to vertebral fractures are estimated to be as high as one billion dollars per year
in the U.S. [[2]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17144789/).

A fundamental barrier to reducing the frequency of vertebral fractures is the lack of
understanding of the properties of the vertebra that control when and how it fails. To address this problem, researchers have begun to use high-resolution, 3-D x-ray imaging to study the failure process in great detail [[3]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1751616113003159). My laboratory [[4]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29196764/) and others [[5]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16532610/) have developed image-processing methods that, when applied to a sequence of 3-D x-ray images obtained during mechanical testing, quantify the deformations that occur at the microscale throughout the vertebra at each stage of the failure process. These methods are based on a process known as digital volume correlation (DVC). Although powerful, these DVC methods are computationally time-consuming and in need of tools that facilitate robust assessments of accuracy.

Therefore, the specific objectives of my project were: (1) to evaluate a multiresolution DVC approach for increases in speed; and (2) to create an independent verification program to evaluate the accuracy of the DVC results.
