I am a first-year Mechanical Engineering Ph.D. student in the [Berkeley Biomechanics Laboratory](https://oconnell.berkeley.edu). My interests lie in uncovering the mechanisms that lead to pain, degeneration, and ailment of the body. Lately, I have been working projects relating to the wrist flexor tendons and intervertebral discs. Specifically, I utilize techniques such as deep learning in combination with medical imaging as well as finite-element modeling.
