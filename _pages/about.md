I am a second-year Mechanical Engineering Ph.D. student in the [Berkeley Biomechanics Laboratory](https://oconnell.berkeley.edu). My interests lie in uncovering the mechanisms that lead to pain, degeneration, and ailment of the musculoskeletal system. I utilize techniques such as deep learning, medical imaging, and finite-element modeling.
